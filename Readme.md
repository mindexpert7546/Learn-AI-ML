#### 1. Supervised Learning :
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that learns from labeled data. Labeled data is data that has been tagged with a correct answer or classification.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning : 
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that learns from unlabeled data. This means that the data does not have any pre-existing labels or categories. The goal of unsupervised learning is to discover patterns and relationships in the data without any explicit guidance.
